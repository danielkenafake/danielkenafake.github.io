        <h4>S01E08 - Movies are your Best Escape</h4>
        <p>
          While watching Movies are Your Best Escape, you will find that it is in fact television that is your best escape. This is a satisfying episode of Hogan’s Heroes with an entertaining briefcase heist, RAF pilots posing as German officers, and a ploy to convince Klink the war goes poorly.

          There are several key moments that make this episode special. The first of which is when Hogan barges in to Klink’s office pushing into the Vermacht soldier standing at guard on the other side. Hogan plays it off cool with an “Easy boy, down, now!” While saluting Klink. There is no way this would pass in real life but it really builds the image of Hogan having all the power here. Klink has no control at all.

          I am reminded of SpaceBalls when thinking of this next scene. Pretending to drop a wine glass and during the clean up, actually picking the briefcase’s lock, is the main event here - there is no denying that. However for me, the winning element is the repetition of orders. Once again another moment where Klink is second to the prisoners. “More wine for the general” is echoed by Hogan, then Klink, then Newkirk. Very reminiscent of the “prepare to fast forward” scene in SpaceBalls. It’s a small gag, sure, but to me its the cherry on top.

          Klink’s strangulation of a cat, or “violin recital” as he calls it, is a symphony for the soul. “You won’t believe what he does to a violin!” Is the understatement of the century from Colonel Hogan. Mozart, Beethoven, move over! If the war never happened perhaps we’d see this side of Klink flourish. We were robbed of this.

          Hitler impersonations happen more often than you may think. Hogans Heroes makes up a healthy percentage of them globally I’m sure. In this episode we are treated to Newkirk’s gravelly interpretation. Not only is it convincing, but it is topped off with the golden line, “Keep smiling.” A truly Hitler-esque statement.

          Part of the plan to extradite the secret documents to England is to send them out with two downed RAF pilots who have been hiding in the tunnel. The emergency tunnel is instantly ruled out as their escape route due to “Too much German activity”. How convenient!
        </p>
        <p>
          After convincing Klink Germany is close to surrender, the RAF men, posing as an archival camera crew from Berlin, enter the camp with a camera preloaded with the roll of secret documents. Klink delivers an artistic interpretation of how Stalag 13 is run - his directorial debut. Rotten tomatoes critic score may be in the low 30’s but at least it would serve his purposes, to portray himself as a true humanitarian in hopes the invading Allied forces will be kind to him.
        </p>

          Without spoiling the entire episode I will leave you with this. The plan does not run smoothly but as far as roadblocks go, they are closer resemble speed bumps. In fact there is very little that goes wrong more than a minor nuisance. My biggest gripe with this episode. It is an episode full of laughs and although it barely entertains the idea of conflict, it is enjoyable and the story is engaging but predictable.

          I would score this episode highly on re-watchability due to some absolute classic Hogan’s Heroes moments, but overall it is “just another episode” amongst many others like it.
