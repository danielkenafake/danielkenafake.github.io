<div class="WideTextBox">
    <p>Website mockup made for <a href="http://danielkenafake.com" target="_blank">danielkenafake.com</a> I decided to go for a maximum of 3 columns to maximise the size of the images. 4 columns felt too crowded.</p><p>I also decided to change the mobile navigation to better reflect the desktop's horizontal layout. Feel free to view the html/ccs for this project on <a href="https://github.com/danielkenafake/danielkenafake.github.io">github!</a></p>
